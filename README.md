  this will be the first page displayed when the reader opens the exposition.
* Do not nest folders into folders.
* You can use .html, .css, image, pdf, audio and video files. 
* JavaScript is currently not supported for security reasons, if present, import will fail.
* The character encoding of the .html files should be UTF-8
