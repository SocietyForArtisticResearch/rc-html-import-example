# This is a demo HTML exposition

This is a demo exposition for the HTML import feature of the RC. The
HTML import feature allows you to import a HTML based exposition. There are a few requirements for this to work:

* The root folder needs to contain a file named __index.html__, this will be the page where the exposition opens
* Do not nest folders into folders.
* You can use .html, .css, Images, Audio and Video. JavaScript is currently not supported for security reasons, if present, import will fail.
